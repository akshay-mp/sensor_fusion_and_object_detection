# SDCND : Sensor Fusion and Tracking
This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, you'll fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. You will be using real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset – Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.

## Sensor Fusion and Object Detection
In this project, the extended Kalman fusion (EKF) filter is applied on Waymo Open Dataset to track the vehicles. 
The project is divided into 4 steps:
1. To track the real-world target with lidar measurement using an EKF filter.
2. Implement track management to initialize and delete tracks, set track state, and track score.
3. Implement a single nearest neighbor data association to associate track.
4. Implement the nonlinear camera measurement model.

### Step 1: EKF filter

In this task, the system states [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz], process model, and constant velocity models are designed and a system matrix with constant velocity and noise covariances for the 3D process model is calculated. This calculation aid in obtaining state h(x) and Jacobian H through computation. By evaluating h(x) and Jacobian H, the current state is calculated. The state and covariance are updated by using computed Kalman gain.

The above graph shows the root mean square of 0.29, less than the desired result of 0.35. 

### Step 2: Track Management

In this task, the unassigned lidar calculations initialize the track. The track score is associated with track measuement, and corresponding scores were increased or decreased accordingly. If the track score is below the minimum threshold, the track gets deleted, or else the track state changes to confirmed status upon reaching a maximum threshold.

<img src="img/Figure_3.png"/>
The above graph shows the root mean square of 0.79

### Step 3: Data Association

In this task, the matrix with all tracks is built and the Mahalanobis Distance for each track measurement is calculated. The hypothesis test Chi-Square is used for removing irrelevant track sets. The Kalman filter is updated with the selected minimum Mahalanobis Distance track set and from the relation matrix, the relevant row and column are deleted. If the calculated Mahalanobis Distance from the inverse cumulative chi-squared distribution is lesser than the threshold, the track measurement will be inside the track's gate.

### Step 4: Sensor fusion module for camera-lidar fusion

In this task, the measurement model's 3D space points are transformed into a 2D image by a projection matrix. The Jacobian is used for the measurement model and partial derivatives of system matrix (x,y,z) w.r.t. measurement models (u,v), camera measurement with measurement noise R helps to check if the track state is within the camera field of view. This aids in either accepting track set measurement or rejecting.

<img src="img/Figure_5.png"/>
The above image shows the root mean square of each track measurement. All the values of mean are below 0.25

 The above video shows the each track measurement.
 
## Obstacles faced:
The transformation of 3D point space to a 2D image in the camera measurement model was difficult due to a slight mismatch that happened while transforming from the x,y,z coordinates to camera axis coordinates. I faced an issue while running track management from step 2 due to preloaded results. I couldn't get the desired results on running the second time.

## Benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking 
The camera alone cannot provide the required detection and tracking, the camera requires aid from Lidar to complete the tracking and detection accurately and with minimum error. The camera has advantages like color recognization, object detection, and classification. The Lidar through its spatial projection of beams can help in adding features like object detection in foggy, rainy, dark conditions and measuring distance. The fusion of camera and lidar through Resnet architecture leads to better detection of objects and increase operational efficiency. 

## Real-life challenges
1. In a real-life scenario, the multiple tracking and measurement are difficult due to its gating threshold.
2. The noise variance for each measurement is different in the real-world scenario, and the noise variance should be variable and not fixed.
3. The process model should be based on accuracy and computations. 

## Improvement Opportunity
In this project, the camera data is restricted to the front camera, and this can be improved by adding multiple cameras which aid in wider object detection and helps in multiple tracking.
